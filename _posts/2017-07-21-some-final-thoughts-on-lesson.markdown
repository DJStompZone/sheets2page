This lesson is a work in progress. It runs on GitHub, and I'm moving it forward like I would any coding project on Github. This lesson runs using the same process described in the lesson. Each step of this lesson lives in a Google Sheet, and is published to Github using a script. However, instead of publishing a single YAML file to the _data folder, it [publishes a single post to the _posts folder](https://github.com/contrafabulists-lessons/google-sheet-to-github-website/tree/master/_posts), taking advantage of the blog featues that Jekyll bring to the table. Each step of the lesson lives as a Jekyll blog post, allowing me to easily paginate through each entry in this lesson--with everything running on Github, keeping things forkable.

I'm looking for feedback on the lesson at each step using Github issues. I have setup a separate open issue for each step of the lesson, opening up a feedback loop for each step of the lesson, that I can use to evolve each step, incorporating feedback within each version I release. I'm looking to keep developing this lesson format, rounding off with video and audio at each step. Helping me harden the approach so that I can fork and use as scaffolding for other lessons, and since it is open on GitHub, anyone else can too. 

This is the first lesson in a catalog of API focused lesson I'm developing. I will start publishing [my API 101 collection to my API 101 research](http://101.apievangelist.com), and then work my way down the API lifecycle with further lessons. Here is the list of APIs I'm focusing on some 101 lessons about:

Twitter, Google Sheets, Github, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Slack, Dropbox, Paypal, Weather Underground, Spotify, Google Maps, Reddit, Pinterest, NY Times, Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid, Algolia, Keen, Census, Yelp, Walgreens

If there is an API you'd like to see, you can submit your ideas on the Github issues for this step. Let me know your thoughts. I am just getting going with this work, so it can go anywhere. I am still learning what is possible with Jekyll and Liquid, but even the basic Google Sheet data management, publish to GitHub as YAML, and simple display using Liquid is providing exteremly useful--it is how I run [my network of GitHub driven API industry research](http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/).
