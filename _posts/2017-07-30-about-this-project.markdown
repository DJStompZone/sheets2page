This is the first lesson in an ongoing series of lessons I am developing as part of our Contrafabulists effort, and my own API Evangelist work. The goal is to provide short, easily consumed lessons around specific platforms, technology, and in many cases APIs. Each lesson runs as a Google Sheet with a corresponding Github repository and website that is driven by YAML, Liquid and HTML. 

This lesson is focused on teaching the process behind driving a data driven website on GitHub Pages, with Google Sheets as the backend. I'm hoping you will leave this lesson with the ability to publish your own lessons in this way, and any other type of data driven site in this way. Each step in this lesson has a title, body, image, links and in some cases audio or video. 

I'm also adding a help link which will take you to the Github issues for each step in this lesson, where you can engage in conversations abou the step, and ask questions of the author and other users. I'm looking forward to your feedback, so I can improve on the lesson for future students. I'm looking to make these as helpful and informative as I possibly can, helping folks understanding the possibilities with data driven websites in this way.
