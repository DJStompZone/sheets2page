This is the first lesson in an ongoing series of lessons I am developing as part of our Contrafabulists platform, and my own work as the API Evangelist. I am looking to provide short, easily consumed lessons around specific platforms, technology, and in many cases APIs. Each lesson runs as a Google Sheet with a corresponding GitHub repository and website that is driven by YAML, Liquid and HTML. 

This particular lesson is focused on teaching the process behind driving a data driven website on GitHub Pages, with Google Sheets as the backend--which is the same process I'm using to deliver this lesson. I'm wanting you to leave this lesson with the ability to publish any type of data-driven website using just Google Sheets and Github. Each step in this lesson has a title, body, image, links and in some cases audio or video, helping guide you through the concepts involved.

I'm also adding a help link which will take you to the GitHub issues for each step in this lesson, where you can engage in conversations, and ask questions of me and other readers. I'm looking forward to any feedback I can get, so that I can improve on the lesson for future students. I'm looking to make these as helpful and informative as I possibly can, helping folks understand the possibilities when it comes to delivering data driven websites in this way.
