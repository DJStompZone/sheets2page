Now that you have a repository setup as part of your Github account, we need to turn it into a website, so we can give it a look, publish our spreadsheet data to it, to drive the content of the website. Github provides a pretty handy solution for turning any Github repository into a website, called Github Pages.

Make sure you are in your GitHub account, on the home page for the repository you just forked. Click on the settings tab and scroll down until you see the Github Pages section. First you are going to give the repository a source, selecting the master branch from the dropdown. Once selected hit save, and the page is going to reload, forcing you to scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section of the settings page.

The next step in the set up process is to choose a theme. Click on the button and you will be taken to a page where you are given the option to choose from six website themes. Select the theme you desire and you will be given the ability to commit your changes, with an option to leave a title and description if you wish.

Once the page reloads you will be back at the home page for your repository. Visit the settings one more time, and scroll to the Github Pages section one last time. You will now see a URL for your now published website, allowing you to browse the frontend of the website, or manage the content via the repository or the cloned copy you have on your desktop.
