This portion of this lesson assumes that you already ahve a Github account, and are somewhat familar create a repository. You do not need to be able to code to operate Github. Just think of repositories as folders, and each data project you create will have a folder, and eventually a website using Github Pages. 

In your Github account, select to add new repository. You will be given the option to give the repository a unique name, a short description. THe repository will be a public repository, and you will need to select the checkbox to include a README, then choose green create repository button. You now have a version controlled folder where you can store files, images, data, and next we'll show you how to also turn it into a website.
