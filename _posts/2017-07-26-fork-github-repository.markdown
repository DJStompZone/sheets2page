This portion of this lesson assumes that you already ahve a GitHub account, and are somewhat familar with creating a GitHub repository. You do not need to be able to code to operate GitHub. Just think of repositories as folders, and each data project you create will have a folder, and eventually a website using GitHub Pages. 

To create a new repository make sure you are logged into your GitHub account, then [visit the GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/contrafabulists-toolbox/google-sheet-to-github-website), and click on the fork button in the top right corner. Forking of this project's GitHub repository will just copy this repository (folder) into the Github organization or user account of your choosing. You will then have your own copy of the project to play with and use without any effect on main project.

You now have your own copy of this data project, in a GitHub repository you control. You now have the equivalent of a hosted folder on a server, in this case it is GitHub's servers. You can view the content of the folder with the GitHub website, or clone using the desktop application and work on locally--I recommend doing this. Now that we have a hosting location for our data driven project, we need take another step and make it a website.
