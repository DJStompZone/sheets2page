This is a lesson in how to pubish and manage a data driven website using Google Sheets as the data source, and GitHub Pages as the public website. Think of it as a low costs static way of doing WordPress, but instead of a MySQL database we are using Google Sheets, and instead of PHP we are using Jekyll, with everything hosted on GitHub Pages. 

So, why would you want to do this?

- **Low Cost** - Google Sheets, and GitHub Pages (if public) is free to use.
- **Static** - The end result is a static website that is just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Secure** - Static sites do not have all the dynamic aspects of WordPress, opening up fewer doors for bad folks to find.
- **Low Tech** - It is a scrappy, low tech way of doing things, allowing anyone to publish a simple data driven project site.

This lesson is a living project, and depends on the feedback of students to help improve the content. This lesson lives within a GitHub repository, living as YAML entries in the _posts folder. We are mimicking blog behavior to take advantage of a key Jekyll feature, allowing each step of the lesson to live as a individual post--allowing users to "paginate" through the lesson until they reach the final entry. 

[This lesson is an open project that lives on GitHub allowing it to be forked by anyone](https://github.com/contrafabulists-lessons/google-sheet-to-github-website), and implemented under any other GitHub organization or user account. You can participate in the lesson [using the issues section for the project GitHub repository](https://github.com/contrafabulists-lessons/google-sheet-to-github-website/issues), available at each step in the lesson as a link. Thank you for tuning in, and we look forward to your feedback on the lesson.
